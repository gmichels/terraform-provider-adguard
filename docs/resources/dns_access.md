# adguard_dns_access (Resource)



## Example Usage

```terraform
### this resource has been DEPRECATED and will be removed in a future release
### Use the `dns` block in the `adguard_config` resource instead
# manage the DNS access list
# NOTE: there can only be 1 (one) `adguard_dns_access` resource
# specifying multiple resources will result in errors
resource "adguard_dns_access" "test" {
  allowed_clients = ["allowed-client", "192.168.200.200"]
}
```
